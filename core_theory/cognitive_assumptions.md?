Cognitive Assumptions Behind PredictiveCortex

This document outlines the core cognitive and philosophical assumptions that inspire the structure 
and purpose of the PredictiveCortex framework. These ideas are abstracted from human foresight 
mechanisms and mapped onto theoretical LLM capacities.

Assumption 1 ‚Äî Prediction Is a Mental Construct

In humans, prediction is not a direct function of past data, but a projection based on beliefs, 
intentions, analogies, and symbolic reasoning.  
LLMs, while statistical in origin, can be guided to mimic this projectional logic via structured simulation.

Assumption 2 ‚Äî The Mind Simulates Futures, Not Just Data

Cognitive foresight emerges from simulating possible outcomes and emotionally evaluating them before acting.  
PredictiveCortex integrates multi-agent simulation to reflect this inner rehearsal of futures.

Assumption 3 ‚Äî Meaning Precedes Calculation

Humans don‚Äôt reason in raw tokens. Meaning ‚Äî not syntax ‚Äî governs future modeling.  
Thus, LLM predictions must be grounded in ontologies, not just pre-trained embeddings.

Assumption 4 ‚Äî Uncertainty Is an Epistemic Constant

Human prediction accepts risk, ambiguity, and context.  
LLMs should output multiple conditional scenarios, not one overconfident answer.

Assumption 5 ‚Äî Cognitive Constraints Guide Foresight

We don‚Äôt aim to mimic ‚Äúperfect‚Äù AI foresight.  
We simulate **bounded rationality**: reasonable predictions made under limited time, data, or perspective ‚Äî just like humans do.
