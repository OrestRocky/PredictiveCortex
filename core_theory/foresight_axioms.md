Foresight Axioms

These axioms define the theoretical foundations of foresight modeling in AI systems using PredictiveCortex.

Axiom I — Temporal Continuity
Prediction must reflect coherent progression through time. Discontinuities weaken causal integrity.

Axiom II — Ontological Anchoring
No foresight exists without structured knowledge. An LLM must map tokens to domain-specific ontologies.

Axiom III — Causal Multiplicity
From a single cause, multiple futures may unfold. Prediction is the art of ranking possibilities.

Axiom IV — Agent-Centric Variation
Agents influence outcomes based on memory, intention, and environment. No simulation is universal.

Axiom V — Epistemic Modesty
All hypotheses are provisional. No output of an LLM should be mistaken for deterministic truth.

> These axioms govern the constraints, logic, and humility required in designing LLM-based foresight engines.
