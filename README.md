PredictiveCortex

A Theoretical Framework for Foresight-Capable Language Models

"To predict is not to guess — it is to model the unfolding of structured causality across time, agents, and information."  
Orest Yatskuliak, Initiator of the PredictiveCortex Research Project*

 Abstract

PredictiveCortex is an experimental research framework that explores the theoretical capabilities of Large Language Models
(LLMs) to perform **predictive reasoning** through structured simulation. 

Rather than focusing on statistical prediction of text, we investigate whether it is theoretically possible to extend 
an LLM’s capabilities to simulate **causal-temporal systems**, construct **epistemic scenarios**, and perform **multi-agent foresight modeling**.

We postulate that prediction, in its cognitive essence, is an emergent property of:
- Temporal vectorization
- Ontological knowledge structuring
- Multi-agent dynamics
- Causal chain reasoning

This repository lays the theoretical groundwork, partial implementations, and philosophical rationale for future research on cognitive-level
foresight within AI systems.

System Architecture
```
mermaid 
graph TD
    A[Input Scenario Prompt] --> B[Temporal Vectorizer Module]
    B --> C[Ontology Mapper]
    C --> D[Causal Reasoning Engine]
    D --> E[Multi-Agent Simulator]
    E --> F[Predictive Output Hypotheses]

``` 
Each layer contributes to increasing abstraction:
- **Temporal Vectorizer**: Encodes time-based sequences as predictive tokens
- **Ontology Mapper**: Connects raw input with structured knowledge graphs
- **Causal Engine**: Extracts interdependencies and latent triggers
- **Agent Simulator**: Assigns roles and simulates interactions

Example Use Case

Prompt:
```text
Given rising geopolitical tension in Region X and economic decline in Region Y, what plausible chain of events could unfold in the next 12 months?
```

Output (Partial):
```
1. Migration outflows from Region Y increase (Month 3)
2. Resource tensions escalate at the border of X and Y (Month 5)
3. Diplomatic intervention by Z-nation begins (Month 6)
4. Cyber conflict incidents rise globally (Month 9)
```

This is not a "forecast" — it is a **structural simulation** of plausible outcomes based on encoded causality.

Sample Code Snippets

Python: Temporal Token Mapper
```
python
def encode_temporal_vector(event_sequence):
    # Hypothetical vectorization logic
    import numpy as np
    time_factors = [e['timestamp'] for e in event_sequence]
    magnitudes = [e['impact_score'] for e in event_sequence]
    return np.array([t * m for t, m in zip(time_factors, magnitudes)])
```

Go: Agent Causality Chain
```
go
package agent

import "fmt"

type Agent struct {
    Name    string
    Beliefs []string
    Goals   []string
}

func (a *Agent) Act(situation string) string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%s reacts to %s based on beliefs %v", a.Name, situation, a.Beliefs)
}
```
Ontological Structure Table (Example)

| Layer | Domain           | Sample Entities                   | Type         |
|-------|------------------|------------------------------------|--------------|
| L1    | Political        | Nation, Treaty, Sanction          | Concrete     |
| L2    | Economic         | Currency, Inflation, Trade Route  | Abstract     |
| L3    | Sociocultural    | Belief, Protest, Cultural Norm    | Conceptual   |
| L4    | Technological    | AI System, Cyberattack, Databreach| Emerging     |

This schema is injected into the ontology mapper during scenario construction.
